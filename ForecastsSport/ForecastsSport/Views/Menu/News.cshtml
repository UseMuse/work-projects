<h2><a href="/" id="about">About the Author</a></h2>
<p>Hi! My names Jay and I'm a 20 year old web designer from England. My main projects are conducted through my website Six Shooter Media, but I (obviously) also enjoy creating Open Source web templates for general use! You can keep a check on my free templates here which is probably a link worth bookmarking as my templates appear there a couple of weeks before OWD/OSWD due to the design queues. </p>
<p>Another site of mine that you might find interesting if you're setting up a site with a free template like Buy a Button.net. There, for a great price you can purchase a link to your site in the form of a button. This link will obviously provide you site with some additional traffic which is always nice! </p>
